# S-KDE: OpenCL implementation

This code is the OpenCL implementation for the Sample-based Kernel Density Estimation algorithm (S-KDE) for the paper:

Kernel density estimation in accelerators: Implementation and performance evaluation. Unai Lopez-Novoa, Alexander Mendiburu, Jose Miguel-Alonso. The Journal of Supercomputing 72 (2), 545-566.

Requires an OpenCL library and drivers for the available coprocessors. See Readme.txt for more details.
